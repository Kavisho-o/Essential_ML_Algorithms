# Machine Learning Algorithms Implementation

**Active Repository** - New algorithms are being added regularly!

A comprehensive collection of machine learning algorithm implementations from scratch. This repository contains hands-on implementations with detailed explanations and experiments.

## Current Algorithms

### Supervised Learning
- **Linear Regression** - Multiple variants including Ridge and Lasso regularization
- **Logistic Regression** - Binary classification implementation
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** - Instance-based learning algorithm
- **Decision Trees** - Tree-based classification and regression

## Structure
- Each algorithm has its own directory with notebooks and/or Python implementations
- `requirements.txt` lists all Python dependencies

## Status
This repository is actively maintained and updated with new algorithms frequently. Check back often for new implementations!

## Notes
- Notebooks contain detailed explanations and experiments
- All algorithms are implemented from scratch for educational purposes
- Results may vary based on random seeds
